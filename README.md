## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Role Hierarchy

```
Super Admin (Level 4)
    ↓ can manage
Restaurant Owner/Admin (Level 3)
    ↓ can manage
Employee (Level 2)
    ↓ serves
User/Customer (Level 1)
```

**Hierarchy Rules:**

- Higher levels can view and manage lower levels
- Same-level roles cannot manage each other (except Super Admin → Admin)
- Lower levels cannot access higher level features
- Restaurant scoping applies at Admin and Employee levels

### 3.2 Data Ownership Model

**Restaurant Ownership:**

- Each restaurant has ONE primary owner (Admin role)
- Owner is assigned during restaurant approval
- Owner relationship is immutable (requires super admin to change)
- Restaurants can have MULTIPLE employees
- Employees are scoped to ONE restaurant

**Data Scoping:**

- Reservations belong to restaurants
- Reviews belong to users and restaurants
- Points belong to users
- Employees belong to restaurants
- Analytics are scoped by restaurant ownership

### 3.3 Permission Model

**Permission Types:**

1. **Global Permissions** - Super Admin only
2. **Restaurant Permissions** - Owner within their restaurant
3. **Operational Permissions** - Employee within assigned restaurant
4. **Self Permissions** - User for their own data

**Permission Granularity:**

- Resource-based (restaurant, reservation, user, review)
- Action-based (create, read, update, delete, approve)
- Scope-based (own, restaurant, global)

**Permission Matrix:**

| Resource           | Super Admin     | Restaurant Owner                   | Employee                    | User          |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Restaurants (All)  | CRUD            | Read (own)                         | Read (assigned)             | Read (public) |
| Reservations (All) | CRUD            | CRUD (own restaurant)              | RU (assigned restaurant)    | CRUD (own)    |
| Users (All)        | CRUD            | Read (customers of own restaurant) | Read (reservation contacts) | RU (self)     |
| Employees          | CRUD            | CRUD (own restaurant)              | None                        | None          |
| Reviews (All)      | CRUD            | RU (own restaurant)                | Read (assigned restaurant)  | CRUD (own)    |
| Analytics          | All restaurants | Own restaurant                     | None                        | Own stats     |
| Settings           | Global          | Restaurant-specific                | None                        | Profile only  |

### 3.4 Authentication Flow

**Login Process:**

1. User enters credentials
2. System validates username/password
3. System retrieves user role
4. For Admin/Employee: System retrieves restaurant association
5. JWT token generated with role and restaurant scope
6. User redirected to role-appropriate dashboard

**Token Structure:**

```json
{
  "userId": "user_id",
  "role": "admin | super-admin | employee | user",
  "restaurantId": "restaurant_id_if_applicable",
  "permissions": ["permission_array"],
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

**Session Management:**

- JWT stored in httpOnly cookie
- Token refresh on activity
- Role-based token expiration (shorter for admin roles)
- Restaurant scope validated on every request

Extract JWT from Cookie
    ↓
Validate Token Signature
    ↓
Check Token Expiration
    ↓
Extract Role & Restaurant Scope
    ↓
Match Route to Required Permission
    ↓
Validate User Has Permission
    ↓
For Admin/Employee: Validate Restaurant Scope
    ↓
Proceed to Route Handler OR Return 403 Forbidden
```

**Middleware Layers:**

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Authentication Security

**Password Requirements:**

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character
- Password strength meter on registration

**Additional Measures:**

- bcryptjs hashing with salt rounds: 12
- Password reset via time-limited tokens (15 minutes)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (30-minute cooldown)
- Two-factor authentication (optional, recommended for admins)
- Session timeout: 24 hours (users), 12 hours (employees), 8 hours (admins)

### 8.2 Authorization Security

**Role Escalation Prevention:**

- Users cannot self-promote to higher roles
- Role changes require super admin approval
- All role changes logged in audit trail
- Email notification on role modification

**Restaurant Scope Validation:**

- Every request validates restaurant ownership
- Employees cannot access non-assigned restaurants
- Admins cannot access other admins' restaurants
- API responses filtered by ownership before sending

**Permission Checks:**

- Permission validated on every API request
- Client-side checks for UI only (not security boundary)
- Server-side checks are authoritative
- Cached permissions invalidated on role change

### 8.3 Data Protection

**Sensitive Data Handling:**

- Business licenses and tax IDs encrypted at rest
- PII (phone, email) accessible only with appropriate permissions
- Credit card data never stored (Stripe handles)
- Admin passwords rehashed on security policy updates

**Data Access Logging:**

- All sensitive data access logged
- Includes: who, when, what resource, action
- Logs retained for 1 year
- Super admin can audit logs

**Data Deletion:**

- Soft delete for most resources (archive, don't purge)
- Hard delete only for GDPR compliance requests
- Deleted restaurants preserved with 'deleted' status
- User deletion requires super admin approval

### 8.4 Rate Limiting

**API Rate Limits:**

- Unauthenticated: 100 requests/hour
- User: 1000 requests/hour
- Employee: 2000 requests/hour
- Admin: 5000 requests/hour
- Super Admin: 10000 requests/hour

**Special Limits:**

- Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
- Password reset: 3 per hour
- Email sending: 10 per hour (per user)
- File uploads: 5 per hour

**DDoS Protection:**

- Cloudflare integration recommended
- IP-based blocking for abusive requests
- Geographic restrictions (optional)
